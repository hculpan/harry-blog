# First blog post using Harp

This is my first blog post using [Harp](http://harpjs.com/).  I've been thinking
about blogging for a while now and have spent a little time looking at some options.
This isn't the first time I've started a blog, and honestly I'm not sure it will
go anywhere.  But I've had some thoughts about various things recently that I wished
I could post somewhere (even though I'm fully aware that they will be read by no
one).  

The idea for this blog came from the article [Start a blog with Harp](http://kennethormandy.com/journal/start-a-blog-with-harp) 
where the author describes setting up his own blog using Harp.  Although my professional background
is in Java server-side programming, I've been wanting to get more into web programming
and this seemed like a good fit for me.  Obviously it isn't programming, but it allows
me to easily setup a web page using some common web technologies such as Jade and
and Markdown that I can use with other projects.

As for general area of focus, since this is a personal blog, I won't be concentrating
on any specific area or niche.  My main interests are in programming, role-playing
games, and - currently - the computer game [Minecraft](minecraft.net).  But I will most
likely stray into other topics as well.  

We'll see how long it lasts...
