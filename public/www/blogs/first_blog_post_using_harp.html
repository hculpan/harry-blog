                <h1>First blog post using Harp</h1>
<p>This is my first blog post using <a href="http://harpjs.com/">Harp</a>.  I&#39;ve been thinking
about blogging for a while now and have spent a little time looking at some options.
This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve started a blog, and honestly I&#39;m not sure it will
go anywhere.  But I&#39;ve had some thoughts about various things recently that I wished
I could post somewhere (even though I&#39;m fully aware that they will be read by no
one).  </p>
<p>The idea for this blog came from the article <a href="http://kennethormandy.com/journal/start-a-blog-with-harp">Start a blog with Harp</a> 
where the author describes setting up his own blog using Harp.  Although my professional background
is in Java server-side programming, I&#39;ve been wanting to get more into web programming
and this seemed like a good fit for me.  Obviously it isn&#39;t programming, but it allows
me to easily setup a web page using some common web technologies such as Jade and
and Markdown that I can use with other projects.</p>
<p>As for general area of focus, since this is a personal blog, I won&#39;t be concentrating
on any specific area or niche.  My main interests are in programming, role-playing
games, and - currently - the computer game <a href="minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>.  But I will most
likely stray into other topics as well.  </p>
<p>We&#39;ll see how long it lasts...</p>
